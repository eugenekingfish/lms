# Computational searches for fractional Calabi-Yau algebras

This repository was created whilst working on my 2023 [LMS URB](https://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/undergraduate-research-bursaries) project: 
Computational searches for fractional Calabi-Yau algebras, supervised by Dr Joseph Grant (UEA).

## Mathematical Motivation

Given $n \geq 3$, we can construct the linear quiver $Q_n$. This is a quiver of the form $$1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow n-1 \rightarrow n,$$
with the vertices naturally labelled by elements of $\mathbb{N}$ and arrows labelled by $\alpha_i$, where $i$ is the source of the arrow. By choosing a field $k$, 
we can use $Q_n$ to form the path algebra $kQ_n$, on which we can introduce relations. A relation is a non-zero path (of length $\geq 2$) which we define to be zero. What this means is
creating the quotient algebra $\mathcal{Q} = kQ_n / I$, where $I$ is the principal ideal generated by the relations.
***
It is known that, if $I = ()$, then $kQ_n/I$ is fractional Calabi-Yau for any $n$. However, less is known when $I$ is generated by other non-trivial relations.
This repository includes code that allows for testing whether $kQ_n/I$ is fractional Calabi-Yau (fCY) by checking whether the matrix obtained from the projective resolution has finite order. 
It also has the ability to compute the fCY dimension by repeatedly applying the Serre functor to the projective modules.
