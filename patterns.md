# Patterns Observed

## Questions/Conjectures

**Question 1:** Does there exist an $kQ_n \supseteq I$ with $I \neq 0$ such that $kQ_n / I$ is not fCY? <br>
**Question 2:** If $kQ_n / I$ is not fCY, then is $kQ_m/I$ not fCY for every $m > n$? <br>
**Question 3:** By letting $L$ be the set of all relations of length $k$, does the number of $\ell \in L$ passing
the matrix test (``is_fcy_gg``) approach $0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$? <br>
**Question 4:** If $I$ is generated by length two relations, is $kQ_n/I$ fCY for every $n$?

## Even-odd CY dimension pattern
A relation of interest is the length 3 relation $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3$. This passes the matrix test for $4 \leq n \leq 200$
and CY dimensions have been calculated for $4 \leq n \leq 50$. The CY dimensions follow an obvious pattern: if $n$ is even, then the 
dimension is $\dfrac{n-1}{n-1}$. Otherwise, if $n$ is odd, then the dimension is $\dfrac{n-1}{2\left(n-1\right)}$. 
This may be helpful information in support of **Question 2** when considering the contrapositive. Interestingly,
this same even-odd pattern is found for relations of length $n-1$. 

## Spreadsheet patterns

The column corresponding to length 3 relations shows a strictly decreasing percentage of relations pass the matrix test between
$4 \leq n \leq 20$. <br>

It's also of interest to consider the diagonals. How long must we traverse a diagonal before
we only get 0s? For the first diagonal, which represents $n-1$ relations and is compromised entirely of 1s, we 
believe that we will never reach all zeroes, so we must traverse to $\infty$. For the second diagonal, which represents
$n-2$ relations, we reach the chain of zeroes starting on the 6<sup>th</sup> diagonal entry. For the third diagonal, it's 
the 7<sup>th</sup>. Does this pattern continue? if so, this would indiciate that length $n-k$ relations are not fCY for 
every $n > N$ for some $N$.



## Problematic Relation

The first example of a relation that might not be fCY is `[(1,4),(3,6)]` for $n=6$.
